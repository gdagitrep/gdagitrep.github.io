title: Leasing Agent's Guide to Automating Rental Inquiries

---
 
*For leasing agents, landlords, and property managers tired of chasing leads manually*

---

## Why You Need This Guide

If you're listing more than a few rental units, you already know the chaos:

* Renters asking the same questions over and over
* No-shows wasting your time
* Lost leads because you couldn’t reply fast enough

This guide walks you through how to automate the messy parts of the job—from first contact to tour scheduling—so you can focus on closing deals, not answering DMs all day.

We’ll show you how to do this using **Dafri**, a tool built specifically to handle this problem on Facebook Marketplace and Instagram.

## Part 1: The 3 Types of Messages Every Leasing Agent Gets

**1. Is this still available?**

> The #1 question—and a total time suck.

**2. Can I see it today?**

> Most renters want a quick showing and will ghost if delayed.

**3. Tell me more about the apartment.**

> Renters want fast answers, not a wall of text or a form to fill.
